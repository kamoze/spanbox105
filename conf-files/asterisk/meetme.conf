[general]
;audiobuffers=32	; The number of 20ms audio buffers to be used
; when feeding audio frames from non-DAHDI channels
; into the conference; larger numbers will allow
; for the conference to 'de-jitter' audio that arrives
; at different timing than the conference's timing
; source, but can also allow for latency in hearing
; the audio from the speaker. Minimum value is 2,
; maximum value is 32.
;
; Conferences may be scheduled from realtime?
;schedule=yes
;
; Update realtime when members login/out of the conference
;logmembercount=no
;
; How much earlier than the start time should we allow participants to
; join the conference (in seconds)?
;fuzzystart=300
;
; If the participants join too early, how much time should we allow
; to tell them that they've joined too early, rather than telling them
; the conference simply doesn't exist (in seconds)?
;earlyalert=3600
;
; How many seconds before the scheduled end of the conference should
; the participants be warned?
